Sports betting allows fans to engage at a deeper level - leading them to wager money and track stats, storylines, and performances at a game-by-game level. \n","\n","The team plans to explore applications of machine learning to sports betting as it relates to the NBA season. Similar efforts in the past have successfully combined machine learning concepts such as convolutional neural networks with modern portfolio theory to maximize predictive power,  as well as expected profit on NBA betting (Hubáček, 2019). Other examples in sports such as tennis have seen the use of ensemble methods incorporating models such as logistic regression, neural networks, random forests, GBM, and SVM maximize expected return (Wilkens, 2021).\n","\n","The dataset that we will use consists of data from each of the regular and postseason NBA games from the 2007-2008 to the 2021-2022 seasons (Skompinski, 2021). For each game, there are several attributes (100+) involving statistics for each of the teams playing, in addition to some betting data. \n","\n","## Problem Definition:\n","----------------------------------\n","One of the most common forms of sports betting is on the winner of a given matchup. Their simplicity and frequency drives popularity among bettors. Therefore, we considered analyzing winners of individual matches throughout the season.\n","\n","While predicting regular season wins would be a useful tool, we find it more compelling to make forecasts on the winners of playoff matchups, based on regular season data. Teams are often criticized for being “regular season” performers - lacking an “intangible” gear to go into when the heightened postseason atmosphere materializes. More attention and prominence is associated with betting in the playoffs, and oftentimes greater payouts - further solidifying the exercise as a worthwhile one. \n","\n","## Methods:\n","----------------------------------\n","Using our aforementioned NBA game data, we plan on using multiple methods in order to build our predictive model. Namely, we will create a <font color = '419CFF'>convolutional neural network</font> and use a brute force strategy in order to analyze statistics from previous matches and generate a prediction. Additionally, we want to approach the <font color = '419CFF'>data with PCA (Preprocessing Analysis)</font> in order to find metrics for optimal predicted value for game winners. We may also experiment with player datasets in order to refine the model"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# imports\n","import numpy as np\n","import

As the table includes game data from the 2007-2008 to the 2021-2022 NBA season across both regular season and playoff matchups, there are nearly 20,000 rows including over 100 fields. Save for the last four columns, most fields appear in duplicate - this is because they are shown for both teams (e.g., GP - Games Played, FGM - Field Goals Made, REB - Rebounds, etc.). \n","\n","In order to distinguish between fields corresponding to the home team versus the away team, we concatenate a “.1” to the last 54 fields to designate the away team. While our dataset is relatively robust, we did see an opportunity to introduce some labels: namely, a binary “playoff” field.. However, the distinction between playoff and regular season games is not made clear in the data, so we introduced this column to the dataset. Additionally, we find it potentially valuable to add win/loss streak field(s) to demonstrate the effect of momentum on a team’s success. We have not yet implemented this attribute, but plan to for the final iteration.\n","\n","We also removed the first column (index) from the dataset, as it is made redundant by the default indexing of the pandas dataframe we work with. Furthermore, we removed the Date column - the reasons for this are twofold. One, the date column intuitively should have little impact on the winner of a game, as the effect of progression through the season (e.g., fatigue, push for playoff seeding, tanking) should be captured by Games Played and Win/Loss and two, is formatted such that it would be difficult to work with and incorporate into our Principal Component Analysis. Before executing the PCA, however, we needed to encode two categorical variables (Team_Name and Team_Name.1), instead denoting each team with an integer value from 1-30.
